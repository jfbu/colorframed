Release 0.9b du 1er octobre 2022

Téléversé sur CTAN le jeudi 29 septembre vers 19h15

Initial release restored in passing the titled-frame environment
of framed.sty from a breakage induced some years ago by an
upstream LaTeX change.  But due to an oversight the (restored)
layout was not exactly the same as the original.  This is fixed
here.

Also, as further problems emerged with this environment after I
had started experimenting with it, a need for some alternative
macros appeared, and they have been added to the package with no
change to original.

In the initial announcement it was said the package would be
enriched at some point by an environment based on pict2e-based
boxes.  Since then, I have become aware of package longfbox which
provides precisely such boxes.  How this could or should or would
interact with the present package is not clear at this time.
Besides I feel now that if I do any such thing, it should be in
yet another package.

So development should now be quiet.  Issue reports and feature
requests are welcome at the repo site.

corners, optional background colour, external or inset shadow, separate
customizability of the padding separations and border widths in the four
directions, …
