## Purpose

The initial release fixes colour leak issues which one encounters
with the environments from the [framed package](https://ctan.org/pkg/framed).

It is planned to extend the package with one more environment, based upon

with possibly rounded corners, optional background color, external
or inset shadow, etc...
