\section{Description}


This package fixes various colour leaks one encounters with
the environments from Donald Arseneau's package
\ctanpackage{framed}.  Typically, colour leaks occur if using
|\color| (at top level) inside the environments, or more subtly also when
using |\textcolor| with an argument ending up being split at a
page break.

This latter type of colour leak (or colour disappearance) is the
more challenging one as the fix requires modifications or
replacements not only of some of the \ctanpackage{framed}.sty
macros (such as its |\CustomFBox|, which \colorframed overwrites)
but also to some \LaTeX{} internals, as some environments of
\ctanpackage{framed}.sty rely on usage of |\fbox| or |\colorbox|.
Rather than overwriting internal \LaTeX{} macros such as
|\@frameb@x| or |\color@b@x|, \colorframed simply replaces |\fbox|
and |\colorbox| in the \ctanpackage{framed}.sty environments by
appropriate substitutes.

I am aware \ctanpackage{tcolorbox} package documentation explains at
least one colour issue which looks similar to those fixed
here in \ctanpackage{framed} context, and that the fix overthere uses
an extra colour stack, hence is not \XeLaTeX{} compatible
currently.

The problems are solved here without involving an extra
colour stack, hence the fixes work also with \XeLaTeX.

\section{The environments from \ctanpackage{framed}}

  We refer the reader to \ctanpackage{framed} for the official
  documentation and provide here only a few relevant details,
  particularly
  regarding the `titled-frame' environment which is described
  in \ctanpackage{framed} documentation more as being a
  template than a user-level finalized environment.
\begin{titled-frame}{A list of the environments from package \ctanpackage{framed}}
  This list indicates which boxing macros are
  used in the original, and their replacement.

% preamble does not work)

\end{titled-frame}
The previous box gives an example of use of `titled-frame' environment.
  It is an environment with
  one mandatory argument which provides the title of the
  frame, which is repeated after a page break with |(cont)|
  appended.  The colours |TFFrameColor| and
  |TFTitleColor| must have been defined by the user.
  \colorframed adds the possibility to colorize separately the continuation
  label (else it inherits the colour of the frame).  For example we used
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand\colorframedTFconlabcolorcommand{\color{purple}}
\end{verbatim}
  and the default definition of this macro is to do nothing.

    such environment with list items, if the environment is to start
    at start of the item. }
\end{shaded}

%
  The `titled-frame' environment was in effect broken in recent \LaTeX\ which
  has modified how |\smash| behaves (the continuation label created a blank
  line interrupting the framing); \colorframed fixes this infelicity in
  passing.

  To customize
  further usage of `titled-frame' one must renew its definition,
  which is left untouched by \colorframed.
  Here is its source from \ctanpackage{framed}.sty: (code and
  comments by Donald Arseneau)%
\begin{verbatim}
% A particular type of titled frame with continuation marks.  
% Parameter #1 is the title, repeated on each page.
\newenvironment{titled-frame}[1]{%
  \def\FrameCommand{\fboxsep8pt\fboxrule2pt
     \TitleBarFrame{\textbf{#1}}}%
  \def\FirstFrameCommand{\fboxsep8pt\fboxrule2pt
     \TitleBarFrame[$\blacktriangleright$]{\textbf{#1}}}%
  \def\MidFrameCommand{\fboxsep8pt\fboxrule2pt
     \TitleBarFrame[$\blacktriangleright$]{\textbf{#1\ (cont)}}}%
  \def\LastFrameCommand{\fboxsep8pt\fboxrule2pt
     \TitleBarFrame{\textbf{#1\ (cont)}}}%
  \MakeFramed{\advance\hsize-20pt \FrameRestore}}%
%  note: 8 + 2 + 8 + 2 = 20.  Don't use \width because the frame title
%  could interfere with the width measurement.
 {\endMakeFramed}
\end{verbatim}
  The continuation label used in the `titled-frame' environment
  is |$\blacktriangleright$|
  (which despite its name reacts to current text colour setting).
  It requires to
  the best of the author knowledge loading \ctanpackage{amssymb} or
  some other math symbols package and it is up to user to do it.
\end{snugshade}

% \begin{shaded} % nesting does not work
\begin{framed}
\item
\emph{(one can not nest environments of \ctanpackage{framed}.sty, else we would
  have done so here.)}

\textcolor{blue}{(Here is an attempt to use the {`framed'} environment
  around a list item; we can see an unexpected
  induced indentation of the
  paragraph. And, by the way, there is no {`snugframe'} environment which would
  let the border fit not the whole width but only the indented item.)}
\end{framed}
% \end{shaded} % nesting does not work

\begin{snugshade}
\item To customize the `titled-frame' output, one may simply redefine the
  environment via suitable changes e.g. to the setting of |\fboxsep| and
  |\fboxrule|.  But doing so, one quickly discovers that the layout from
  |\TitleBarFrame| has problems (see on this the repository issues \ghissue{3}
  and \ghissue{4}).  So \colorframed |0.9b| provides
  |\colorframedTitleBarFrame|, which can be used as a replacement to
  |\TitleBarFrame| in a redefined custom `titled-framed' environment.  Check
  the source file for some more information.  In particular there is added macro
\begin{verbatim}
\colorframedTFconlabsep
\end{verbatim}
  which one can define to expand to some dimension which will be the separation
  of the continuation label from the right edge of the frame.

  This is all provided as an exception
  to the general rule that this package should take care only of fixing colour
  problems (addition of new environments may be considered in future).

\end{snugshade}
\end{itemize}
\end{footnotesize}


The aim of \colorframed regarding \ctanpackage{framed} existing
code base is strictly limited to fixing the colour leak issues,
there is no general intent to modify the existing environments of
\ctanpackage{framed} for them to acquire additional capabilities and
customizability.

\begin{footnotesize}
  Despite the fact already
  mentioned that anyhow `titled-frame' had been broken some years ago by an
  upstream \LaTeX\ change we did not change it beyond
  fixing this, and the alternative |\colorframedTitleBarFrame| must be
  opted-for explicitly by user in a re-definition of `titled-frame'
  environment, the default remaining with the problematic
  |\TitleBarFrame|. Or the user can do |\let\TitleBarFrame\colorframedTitleBarFrame|.
  \par
\end{footnotesize}
% \color{RawSienna}

Already we have mentioned
\begin{verbatim}
\colorframedTFconlabcolorcommand
\end{verbatim}
whose default definition let it expands to nothing at all (the continuation label
then inherits the |TFFrameColor| colour).

Regarding the `framed' environment, \colorframed adds the
\begin{verbatim}
\colorframedbordercolorcommand
\end{verbatim}
which expands by default to |\normalcolor|.  It influences the colour of the
framing done by environment `framed', the original having no such
customizability.  Do not redefine it to do nothing, it always should set some
colour, else the borders may display colour loss after a page break.

For example
\begin{verbatim}
\setlength{\FrameRule}{5pt}
\setlength{\FrameSep}{9pt}
\renewcommand\colorframedbordercolorcommand{\color{gray!50}}
\end{verbatim}
configures the next usage of `framed'.

\setlength{\FrameRule}{5pt}
\setlength{\FrameSep}{9pt}
\renewcommand\colorframedbordercolorcommand{\color{gray!50}}
\begin{framed}
  This environment allows indeed customization of the border width
  and of the separation with contents, via |\FrameRule| and
  |\FrameSep|.

  The length |\FrameSep| influences also `oframed', `shaded', and `shaded*',
  but `snugshade' and `snugshade*' employ |\fboxsep| rather.

  |\FrameRule| influences both `framed' and `oframed'.
\end{framed}

\section{TODO}

\begin{snugshade}
The author has developed based upon usage of \ctanpackage{pict2e}
breakable boxes with round corners, background colour, optional
shadow (possibly inset), and other goodies and was planning on
incorporating this environment into the package at some time in future.
%
Of course, it will remain limited in comparison to the fully
customizable boxes provided by package \ctanpackage{tcolorbox} (ot
those of \ctanpackage{mdframed}) but our testing showed
significant speed-up in build time, which may matter for long
documents.

% Hopefully this addition will be done when time will permit.

% \thispagestyle{empty}
% \enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}

%\colorlet{shadecolor}{lightgray!50}
% \footnotesize
  But after initial release made it to CTAN on
  2022/09/22 I became aware of \ctanpackage{longfbox} which
  provides already such \ctanpackage{pict2e} breakable boxes with
  rounded corners (even elliptical arcs), and furthermore with a
  CSS-like interface which is exactly what I had done on my side
  too... I need to check more \ctanpackage{longfbox} before a
  decision is made here!  Perhaps it will be better to keep
  \colorframed as it is currently and
  extras such as new \ctanpackage{pict2e}-based boxes with a key-value
  interface to `inline' or `display' boxing macros and environments
  should make it to another package (loading \colorframed of course).
