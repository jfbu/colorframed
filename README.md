This package fixes colour leak issues which one encounters
with the environments provided by the

## CTAN package build instructions ##

Releases (see the [tags](https://github.com/jfbu/colorframed/tags)) are pushed
to [CTAN](https://ctan.org).

To build: `cd` to `colorframed/` and execute there `make ctan`.  This produces
