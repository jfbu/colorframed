## CTAN package build instructions ##

To build: `cd` to `colorframed/` and execute there `make ctan`.  This produces
`colorframed.zip` to be found in the `CTAN/` sub-directory, the files
included into the archive being in the `ctanbuild/` sub-directory.

## Opening a new issue ##

This is what this repo is for, so don't hesitate doing it.

*Please ping me (`@jfbu`) from the issue message.*

Indeed, although once an issue is created (or a PR) I will be notified of any
new comment, or push, it seems there is no way to let GitHub notify me of *new
issues*, because of my global preferences on repos I watch.  Basically, for
getting notified, I would have to activate the functionality for *all repos I
watch*, there is no way to activate it *only for the repos I own*.  Repos I
watch still notify me when I am mentioned or when a comment is made on an
issue I contributed to.  I currently don't want my email account to be flooded
with all the activity on various repos I do watch, and again, there seems to
be no way to configure GitHub to send notifications on more events *only
for repos I own*.

Last investigated on 2021/11/06 (for another repository).
If I am missing something obvious, please tell me.
